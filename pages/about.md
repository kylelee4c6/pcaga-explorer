## About ClerkGPT

Welcome to **ClerkGPT**!

This simple tool is here to help you explore and search through historical documents from the [PCAhistory.org](https://www.pcahistory.org) website. Whether you're looking into past General Assembly actions, committee reports, or other documents important to the Presbyterian Church in America, this app can help you find what you're looking for‚Äîquickly and clearly.

### ü§ñ How It Works (In Plain English)

* **Smart Search with AI**: Instead of just showing a list of results, this app uses a kind of artificial intelligence (AI) called *GPT-4o Mini* from OpenAI. You can ask it questions in plain English, and it will do its best to read through the documents and give you a helpful answer in everyday language.

* **Document Storage**: All the PCA documents are stored safely in a modern, cloud-based system called **AstraDB**. Think of it like a very large digital filing cabinet that‚Äôs always organized and ready when you need it.

* **Built with Streamlit**: The app is built using a tool called *Streamlit*, which helps create easy-to-use websites like this one, without needing users to install anything or deal with complicated settings.

### üï∞Ô∏è Why This App Exists

**Whereas**, the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA) maintains a rich history of theological reflection, ecclesiastical decision-making, and denominational development; and

**Whereas**, the documents preserved on [PCAhistory.org](https://www.pcahistory.org)‚Äîincluding General Assembly minutes, committee reports, and historical writings‚Äîserve as a valuable resource for teaching, study, and faithful church governance; and

**Whereas**, access to these historical materials can be challenging due to the volume and complexity of the archives; and

**Whereas**, technological tools now make it possible to simplify and enhance access to these documents without compromising their integrity or context;

**Therefore be it resolved**, that this application has been developed to serve as a research assistant to elders, pastors, and members of the PCA by providing an intuitive, conversational way to search and understand the materials found on PCAhistory.org; and

**Be it further resolved**, that this tool exists not to replace personal study or the work of the courts of the church, but to assist in it‚Äîby making our history more accessible, searchable, and useful for the building up of the Church.

### üì¨ Contact + About Me

Hi! I'm **Kyle Lee**, a data scientist at [Elder Research](https://www.linkedin.com/company/elder-research-inc/posts/?feedView=all), currently living in the D.C. area. I'm a member at [Christ Presbyterian Church in Burke, VA](https://www.cpcburke.org), and over the years I've had the joy of serving in several NAPARC churches‚Äîas a missions committee member, deacon, clerk, and website administrator (currently).

This project is a personal effort to make PCA history more accessible, and to encourage thoughtful engagement with technology in service of the Church. I know that many in the Reformed world tend to approach technology (especially in the latest advances in AI) with caution‚Äîand rightly so. But that caution can sometimes lead to falling behind or missing opportunities to use new tools in ways that honor Christ. My hope is that this app not only helps elders, pastors, and members with historical research, but also inspires others with technical skills to think creatively about how they can serve the Church with excellence and discernment. I write this in gratitude for the many faithful elders and deacons who have served me over the years and shaped my trajectory to do the same for others. Soli Deo Gloria!
