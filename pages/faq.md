# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

#### **What is this app actually doing when I ask a question?**

This app searches through a collection of PCA historical documents—like General Assembly records, committee reports, and other archived materials—and finds sections that are most relevant to your question. Then, it uses a language model (a type of AI) to summarize or explain those sections in plain English.

#### **What is “RAG”?**

RAG stands for *Retrieval-Augmented Generation*. It's just a fancy way of saying the app first **retrieves** relevant information from the documents, and then **generates** a helpful response based on that information. The AI doesn’t make up answers from thin air—it’s grounded in the documents it's been given.

#### **Is this giving me official PCA interpretations?**

No. This tool is helpful for research and getting oriented, but it should never be treated as an official or final interpretation of PCA documents. Always double-check with the source materials, your session, presbytery, or trusted church leaders.

#### **Can the AI give wrong answers?**

Yes. While it’s designed to be helpful, the AI might misunderstand your question or summarize things imperfectly. It's like asking a well-read assistant—it tries its best, but it’s not infallible. At the end of the day, every word you type gets converted into a multi-dimensional value and predicts the best word that follows it (to put it simplistically). 

#### **Does this replace reading the original documents?**

Not at all! This tool is meant to help you **find** the right documents and **understand** them faster, but it's not a replacement for careful reading and study.

#### **Can I trust it with sensitive or private information?**

Please don’t enter personal, private, or sensitive information. This tool is designed for public historical research, not for pastoral counseling or handling confidential matters. I may need to track queries in a database.

#### **Is the AI learning from what I type?**

No. This app does not store or use your questions to train the AI. Everything you type stays private within your session. Also, it's too expensive to fine-tune the model. I welcome an overture for a dedicated set of funds, say in the millions, to refine an OpenAI model.

#### **Does this cost anything?**

Not for you. I am currently absorbing the costs. So if you have questions that aren't about the documents, just go to ChatGPT's website. Please don't use it for your grocery shopping. Overture writing, maybe. 

#### **The references look weird. What happened?**

Some documents are poorly formatted for a variety of reasons. Maybe they're scanned. When I build the database, I go through each of the 700+ documents and break down the text by every N number of characters with code. It is a harder problem to break down the text of each document into meaningful sections (and also costs some additional monies to do it well) which is why I provide the original URL so you can take a look at the document itself. 

#### **Why is a tool like this even necessary?**

The PCA has a deep and rich history, but navigating that history can be difficult. Many in the Reformed world are cautious with technology—and that’s a good thing. But tools like this can help bridge the gap, making that history more accessible while honoring our commitment to truth and careful study.
